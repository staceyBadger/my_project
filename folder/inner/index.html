    <h1>Saint Patrick`s Day</h1>
    <p>
        Saint Patrick's Day, or the Feast of Saint Patrick (Irish: Lá Fhéile Pádraig, lit. 'the Day of the Festival of Patrick'), is a cultural and religious celebration held on 17 March, the traditional death date of Saint Patrick (c. 385 – c. 461), the foremost patron saint of Ireland.

        Saint Patrick's Day was made an official Christian feast day in the early 17th 
        century and is observed by the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion
        (especially the Church of Ireland),[6] the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the 
        Lutheran Church. The day commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity
        in Ireland,[5] and celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general.[7] 
        Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, céilís, and the wearing 
        of green attire or shamrocks.[8] Christians who belong to liturgical denominations 
        also attend church services[7][9] and historically the Lenten restrictions on eating 
        and drinking alcohol were lifted for the day, 
        which has encouraged and propagated the holiday's tradition of alcohol consumption.
